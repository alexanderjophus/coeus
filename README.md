# Project Coeus

This is a collection of services designed to work with [stats-importer](https://github.com/alexanderjosephtrelore/stats-importer).
The idea being stats-importer collates information from [NHL stats](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/blob/master/stats-api.md), and imports them into pachyderm.
These projects then reads off that pachyderm repo and transform/manipulate that data in multiple ways.
